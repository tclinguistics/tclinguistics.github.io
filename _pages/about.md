### 
Hey there! 

I'm... a linguist. A community linguist.

I'm here to inspire your awareness of languages and cultures! I also want to bring to your attention linguistic, educational, and sociocultural issues in the Philippines and beyond. Through this initiative, we will:
* publish public-friendly videos and infographics (primariabout language-related matters;
* hold various educational discussions and knowledge building events like reading groups and brainstorming sessions;
* interview emerging and distinguished language researchers and allow them to share their work! 

Our content will be in English, Tagalog, or both. Maybe someday, we can add other named languages.

Follow us on our social media platforms!
