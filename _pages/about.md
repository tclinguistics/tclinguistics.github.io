### Welcome!

Hey there! 

I'm Gab. I'm just your ordinary community linguist.

*The Community Linguist* is a initiative that wants to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity. It will also share ideas and bring to your attention various linguistic, educational, cultural, and sociopolitical issues in the Philippines and beyond. 

We will make all these possible by:
* publishing easily digestible videos and infographics (primarily about language-related matters);
* hold various educational discussions and knowledge building events (e.g., reading groups, brainstorming sessions);
* interviewing emerging and distinguished language researchers and allow them to share their work; and
* enable communities to value their languages and their multilingual identities. 

Our content will be in English, Tagalog, or both. Maybe someday, we can add other named languages.

Follow us on our social media platforms!
