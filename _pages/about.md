### Welcome

*The Community Linguist* is a broad initiative to promote awareness of linguistic and sociocultural diversity in our communities. In so doing, we will share and question ideas about languages, communication, culture, and people. Since we believe that linguistic, educational, cultural, and sociopolitical issues - whether in the Philippines or elsewhere - are ultimately interrelated and have huge implications, it's unavoidable that we'll bring these matters to your attention. 

Some of the activities that we (will) do include:
* publishing easily digestible videos and infographics (primarily about language-related matters);
* holding various educational discussions and knowledge building events (e.g., reading groups, brainstorming sessions);
* interviewing emerging and distinguished language researchers and allow them to share their work; and
* enabling communities to value their languages and their multilingual identities. 

Our content will be in English, Tagalog, or both. Maybe someday, we can add other named languages.
